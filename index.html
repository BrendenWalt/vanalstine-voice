          I believe deeply in the power of balance. In life, finding the fine line between your comfort zone and freedom of self
          can be a very delicate balance, and is always incredibly different depending on the individual. This is no different
          when it comes to the singing voice. Every student is an individual, and should have a vocal program tailored to their
          voice.
          <br><br>
          Technically speaking, my approach to voice is a balance between breath energy and resonance. These two are the
          powerhouses which lead the voice to a place of strength, ease, clarity and repeatability. To achieve this balance, I
          work with a huge toolbox of options which I employ differently depending on the student in front of me. All the tools I
          use are in an effort to help my student experience the sensation of loose and free singing, ranging from working with
          internal physical sensations to using visualization to find your unique voice.
          <br><br>
          I find my balance as a teacher between my professional qualifications, knowledge of the science of voice, and my
          absolute love of human beings as individuals. I pride myself on having a comfortable, creative and joyous atmosphere
          within my voice lessons.

          My name is Stephanie VanAlstine, and VanAlstine Voice is my New York City based voice studio. In May 2018 I graduated
          from New York University with a Master’s Degree in Music, specifically studying Vocal Performance: Music Theatre. I
          also received an Advanced Certificate in Vocal Pedagogy, or the science of teaching voice.
          <br><br>
          When I decided to go to graduate school to study voice, it was because I had always felt as though there was another
          level I could reach with my voice, but I couldn’t figure out the key on my own. I had been struggling with feeling as
          though my voice wasn’t quite good enough, and I would never have the kind of consistent and powerful sound that I
          craved. Through my education as a singer and a teacher, I have found my voice as well as finding a passion for helping
          others to break through this same wall I was facing. The freedom I now feel in my own voice is what I always work to
          help my students find, using a foundation of science and a flexibility to tailor my program to the student in front of
          me.
          <br><br>
          I absolutely love working with singers, particularly those who think they can’t sing or have never ventured into the
          singing world. I find there are a huge number of these people who have a desire for music and have a story they want to
          tell with their voice! There is nothing I enjoy more than helping my students realize the full potential of their
          voice, and the transformation I see in them both vocally and personally. The singing voice is one of the most personal
          things we as humans posses. Join me in finding your personal sound!
